A high amount of training data is required to train the ML model to perform accurately. This training data is prepared by labeling unlabeled raw data.\n\nCurrently, manual labeling is what is commonly used.\n\nManual data labeling has the following key pain points :\n\n1. The labels are prone to human errors especially if the annotators don't have the right domain knowledge.\n\n2. It takes a lot of time to manually annotate data, with annotators taking weeks or months to label data depending on the volume and the use case.\n\n3. The manual data labeling process is costly with manual data labeling companies charging per annotation.\n\n4. Data privacy can also become an issue with manual data labeling companies not being able to ensure 100% data privacy at scale.\n\nAt Expand AI, we have automated the data labeling process to solve the key pain points that exist with manual data labeling :\n\n1. We provide >95% accurate labels regardless of the domain the data belongs to because our ML models can be made to be domain-specific very easily.\n\n2. Our ML models can label each data point in one second on average and as a result, we've been able to reduce the turnaround time by at least 70%.\n\n3. Because we use ML models to annotate data we can charge per example point instead of per annotation point and as a result, we're able to reduce the unnecessary spending on data labeling.\n\n4. We ensure 100% data privacy at scale.\n\nAI/ML at Expand AI :\n\nA tangible impact on customer/patron experiences is the constant cornerstones for 'models in production.' Curiosity, humility, continuous learning, excellence, a bias for action - are a few words that summarize the colleagues you will be collaborating with across engineering, product, and business teams. Some of the problem statements being solved at Expand AI with AI/ML are :\n\n1. Generating highly accurate labeling predictions for data points in a very low turnaround time - one second per data point (image/sentence) on average.\n\n2. Making it easy to make the models domain-specific so that the models can give accurate predictions for any use case that the data may belong to.\n\nQualifications :\n\n1. Bachelors/Masters degree in Computer Science or any other STEM degree. Preferably graduated with high distinction.\n\n2. Should have extensive experience with building ML models in a company setting for commercial purposes and should have a good understanding of different ML algorithms.\n\n3. Must have specialization/strong expertise in sub-area like recommendation systems, NLP, computer vision, MLOps.\n\n4. Working know-how of dealing with large-scale data sets.\n\n5. Clear spike in either dealing with extensive data, statistics, driving impact, ML algorithms know-how, DL architectures.\n\n6. Expertise in programming and scripting.\n\nExpected Start Date: 1/3/2022\n\nJob Type: Full-time\n\nSalary: \u20b980,000.00 - \u20b9150,000.00 per month\n\nSchedule:\n\nFixed shift\nExperience:\n\nMachine learning: 3 years (Preferred)\nWork Remotely:\n\nYes\n\n"
